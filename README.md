I have never been able to find a suitable desk that is both the correct size for someone my height (short) and built sturdy enough. The only desk that might have worked are adjustable moving desks, but those are really expensive. Seeing as I couldn't buy the desk I wanted, I decided to make one to my exact dimensions. 

This model assumes you have the LINNMON table top from IKEA (https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/linnmon-tabletop-black-brown-00251343/)
